![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e12b901-2747-48d3-9a73-bb572cbf558c)


## 🎯 Project Overview
A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python as part of the  **Day 4** in the _"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"_ by **Dr. Angela Yu**.. This project demonstrates the implementation of basic game logic, user input handling, and ASCII art in Python.

## ✨ Features
- 🎲 Interactive command-line interface
- 🖼️ ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- 🎯 Random computer opponent
- 🏆 Win/Lose/Draw game logic
- 🎨 Emoji-rich user feedback
- ⚡ Real-time game results


## 🎮 How To Play

This is a simple command-line game where:
- The user selects a number from `0` to `2`:
  - `0` = Rock  🪨
  - `1` = Paper  📄
  - `2` = Scissors  ✂️
- The computer randomly picks one of the three choices
- The game then compares both inputs and prints the result: Win, Lose, or Draw

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- `if-elif-else` logic  
- Handling user input  
- Using Python's `random` module  
- Comparing values and building game logic  
- Writing clean, readable, and interactive Python code
- ASCII art implementation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Random module for computer choices
- ASCII art for visual representation
